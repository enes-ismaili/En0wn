# En0wn – Windows Privilege Escalation Lab

En0wn is a **vulnerable Windows virtual machine** created as a **free alternative to the Devel machine from Hack The Box**.

I built this VM while preparing for the **PNPT exam**, specifically the **Windows Privilege Escalation** section, after realizing that the original Devel machine requires a paid subscription.  
The goal was to recreate the **same learning experience and attack paths** and make it available to everyone.
